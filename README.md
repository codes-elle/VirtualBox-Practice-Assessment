Evaluate the practical knowledge and skills using VirtualBox for virtualization. 

**Assignment Title: VirtualBox Performance-Based Questions**

**Objective:** Evaluate the practical knowledge and skills of students in using VirtualBox for virtualization.

**Instructions:**
1. This assignment consists of 15 performance-based questions related to VirtualBox.
2. Ensure you have VirtualBox installed on your computer before attempting the assignment.
3. Read each question carefully and perform the required actions in VirtualBox.
4. Provide detailed explanations or screenshots where necessary.
5. Save your responses in a document and submit it according to the instructions given by your instructor.

**Questions:**

1. **Virtual Machine Creation:** Create a new virtual machine with the following specifications: 
   - Name: VM1
   - Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04
   - 2 GB RAM, 20 GB hard disk

2. **Snapshot Creation:** Take a snapshot of the VM1 and name it "InitialSnapshot." Provide a brief explanation of the purpose of taking snapshots.

3. **Networking Configuration:** Configure the network settings of VM1 to use the Bridged Adapter mode. Explain the difference between Bridged and NAT networking modes.

4. **USB Device Connection:** Connect a USB device (e.g., a flash drive) to VM1. Provide steps on how to connect and disconnect USB devices in VirtualBox.

5. **Shared Folders:** Create a shared folder between your host machine and VM1. Access and modify a file in the shared folder from VM1.

6. **Guest Additions Installation:** Install Guest Additions on VM1. Explain the benefits of installing Guest Additions in a virtual machine.

7. **CPU and Memory Configuration:** Modify the number of CPU cores assigned to VM1 to 2 cores. Also, increase the RAM to 4 GB. Explain how these changes can impact VM performance.

8. **Network Adapter Types:** Change the network adapter type of VM1 to Paravirtualized Network (virtio-net). Discuss the advantages of using Paravirtualized Network adapters.

9. **Clone Virtual Machine:** Clone VM1 and name the clone "VM1_Clone." Explain the difference between cloning and creating a snapshot.

10. **Remote Display:** Enable Remote Display for VM1. Connect to VM1 using a VNC client from your host machine.

11. **Disk Management:** Resize the hard disk of VM1 to 30 GB. Describe the steps involved in resizing a virtual hard disk in VirtualBox.

12. **Nested Virtualization:** Enable nested virtualization for VM1. Explain the concept of nested virtualization and its use cases.

13. **VM Grouping:** Create a VM group with VM1 and VM1_Clone. Explain the benefits of organizing virtual machines into groups.

14. **Command Line Usage:** Using the VBoxManage command-line tool, list all running virtual machines and their details.

15. **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor the performance of VM1 in real-time using the VirtualBox Performance Graphs. Explain the significance of monitoring VM performance.

**Note:** Ensure that your responses are clear, concise, and include all necessary details to demonstrate your understanding of VirtualBox concepts and operations.
